### Migration Guide

If upgrading from version 1.1.5, please:

1. **Update dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Review security settings**: Check `config.py` for new configuration options
3. **Read security guide**: Review `SECURITY_README.md` for important legal and security information
4. **Test file uploads**: Verify the new upload validation doesn't break your workflow
5. **Monitor logs**: New security event logging provides better visibility

### Breaking Changes

- **File upload behavior**: Files now saved to `snapshots/` directory instead of root
- **File validation**: Stricter file type validation may reject previously accepted files  
- **Rate limiting**: New rate limits may affect high-frequency usage patterns

### Security Recommendations

- Always use HTTPS in production environments
- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor logs for security events
- Implement proper access controls
- Follow the security checklist in `SECURITY_README.md`
